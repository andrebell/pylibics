        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The Image Cytometry Standard (ICS) is a file format for images, primarily in
        microscopy imaging. The file format has been described by `Dean1990`_. ICS
        files allow to store further information on the imaging system along with the
        actual image (e.g aperture, light setting, microscope, and camera). Moreover,
        the file format allows to store several integer format, floating point images as
        well as complex valued images.
        
        The library `libics`_ is a C library to read an write ICS image files. This
        module wraps the functions provided by libics to Python. Actual image data are
        returned as numpy arrays. Numpy array in turn can be written to ICS image files.

        Limitations and known bugs
        --------------------------
        
         - Ics data written as version 2.0 is broken
         - Accessing ics history entries with the iterator interface
           seems not to work properly
         - Compression appears to be not working

        Installation instructions
        -------------------------
        
        You can download the `source code package`_ to compile everything yourself or
        you can use easy_install to install the precompiled package (py2.6, win32 and
        linux, x86_64). To compile the package please follow the instructions provided
        in the README file.
        
        Windows
        -------
        
        Installing with easy_install is done by calling from the windows command
        prompt (C:\>):
        
          C:\> easy_install pylibics
        
        Linux
        -----
        
        Installing with easy_install is done by calling from the command prompt:
        
          > easy_install pylibics
